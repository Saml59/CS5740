A primer on this task is provided further on.  We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 entity labels -- **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity) -- as well as a BIO-format prefix **B-** (token is the *beginning* of a named entity) or **I-** (token is *inside* a named entity). Overall, this yields 9 different labels: **B-ORG, I-ORG, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, B-MISC, I-MISC** and **O**.\n","\n","For this project, you will implement two sequence labeling approaches:\n","- Model 1 : a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n","- Model 2 : a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM)/Logistic Regression classifier (also known as a MaxEnt classifier). Feature engineering is strongly suggested for this model!\n","\n","A key component of both models is implementation of the Viterbi algorithm, which we will use to find the most likely tag sequence to assign to an input text."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mib4pTXj3hir"},"source":["## **Logistics**\n","\n","---\n","\n","- You are **strongly encouraged** to work in **groups of 2 students**.
